# Protocols

This folder contains a collection of all daily review protocols.
Please write your daily protocol in **markdown format** (*.md). This is a nice way to have a formatted text on github. In the [daily protocol template](protocol_template.md) you can see the basic structure of the protocol and some tips on formatting text in markdown as well as how to add pictures or gifs.
